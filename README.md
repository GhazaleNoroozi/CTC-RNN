# CTC-RNN
##Refrences
* I implemented the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss based on Graves, Alex, et al. "Connectionist temporal classification: labeling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural networks." Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Machine learning. ACM, 2006f. 
* I used [AudioLoader](https://github.com/KinWaiCheuk/AudioLoader) implemented by KinWaiCheuk to download the TIMIT dataset
